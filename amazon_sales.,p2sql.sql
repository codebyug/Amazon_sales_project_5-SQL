/*Summary:
order_date <= current_date - interval '6 months': Finds orders on or before the date 6 months ago. 
		Useful for identifying old activity or lack of recent sales.

order_date > current_date - interval '6 months': Finds orders within the last 6 months. 
		Useful for identifying recent sales or activity.

In your context, if you're looking for sellers who haven't made sales in the last 6 months, 
		you'd use order_date <= current_date - interval '6 months'. 
		If you're looking for those who have made sales in the last 6 months,
